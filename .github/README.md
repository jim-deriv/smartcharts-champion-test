#### Comprehensive Inputs
| Input | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `repository` | No | `${{ github.repository }}` | Primary repository (validated format: owner/repo) |
| `ref` | No | - | Primary branch/tag/SHA |
| `alternate_repository` | No | - | Fallback repository (validated format: owner/repo) |
| `alternate_ref` | No | - | Fallback branch/tag/SHA |
| `path` | No | - | Checkout path |
| `fetch-depth` | No | `1` | Number of commits to fetch (validated positive integer) |

| `repository_used` | Actual repository checked out |
| `ref_used` | Actual ref checked out |

#### Enhanced Usage Example
```yaml
- name: Checkout with comprehensive fallback
  uses: ./.github/actions/checkout
  with:
    repository: 'primary-org/repo'

3. **Secret Management**: SSH keys stored securely in repository secrets
4. **Input Validation**: Custom actions validate all inputs
5. **Error Sanitization**: Sensitive information excluded from logs

### Security Best Practices
- Regularly rotate SSH keys
- Monitor workflow runs for suspicious activity
- Keep action dependencies updated
- Review PR changes before approval
- Use branch protection rules for sensitive branches

### Audit Trail
- All deployments are tracked via git commits
- Workflow runs provide complete execution history
- PR comments maintain deployment status records
- GitHub Pages deployment history is preserved
